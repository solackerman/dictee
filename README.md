# French Dictee Practice

## Try it out locally

1. Open `index.html` directly in your browser (double-click it or drag it into a tab).
2. Add your words and click **Practice**.

The app will store your word list in `dictee.txt` (via your browser’s file picker). Use **Load dictee.txt**, **Save dictee.txt**, and **Delete dictee list** to manage it.

## Celebration image

When a word is spelled correctly, the app updates the celebration photo on the right. You can customize the image URLs by editing the `backgroundImages` list in `index.html`.
