# French Dictee Practice

## Try it out locally

1. Open `index.html` directly in your browser (double-click it or drag it into a tab).
2. Add your words and click **Practice**.

The app will store your word list in `dictee.txt` (via your browser’s file picker). Use **Load dictee.txt**, **Save dictee.txt**, and **Delete dictee list** to manage it.

## Background images on correct answers

When a word is spelled correctly, the app cycles the page background through a list of image URLs (search for `backgroundImages` in `index.html`). Replace those links with your preferred “katseye” or “cute corgi” images.
